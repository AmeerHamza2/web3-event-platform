# Web3 Event Platform

An event-driven microservices platform in Go. A public API gateway fronts
several independently deployable services that communicate asynchronously over a
NATS message bus. `docker compose up` runs the whole stack; `make smoke`
exercises it end to end.

| Service | Role | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `gateway` | OAuth2 token issuance, JWT verification, RBAC, rate limiting, reverse proxy | 8080 (public) |
| `user` | User identities; publishes `user.created` | 8081 |
| `wallet` | Ethereum key custody (encrypted keystore); publishes `wallet.created` | 8082 |
| `notification` | Event consumer | 8083 |
| `chainmonitor` | Follows an EVM chain: indexes blocks + ERC-20 transfers into Postgres, handles reorgs, publishes `chain.*` | 8084 |
| `margin` | Portfolio margin engine: values an account's on-chain holdings and computes a health factor / margin status | 8085 |

### Chain Monitor

`chainmonitor` follows the chain tip over JSON-RPC and indexes blocks and ERC-20
`Transfer` logs into Postgres. It is built for the realities of an L1:

- **Event/log decoding.** `Transfer(address,address,uint256)` logs are filtered
  by topic and decoded via the parsed ABI (indexed args from topics, value from
  data).
- **Reorg handling.** Each block is checked for parent-hash linkage and the tip
  is re-validated every poll; on divergence the affected blocks are rolled back
  (transfers cascade-delete) and re-indexed on the canonical chain.
- **Confirmations / finality.** A block is marked `confirmed` only after a
  configurable depth (`CONFIRMATIONS`), so reorgs only ever touch unconfirmed
  data.

The reorg, confirmation-gating, and decode logic are unit-tested against a fake
chain backend, so the suite runs with no network or node.

> **RPC endpoint:** sustained indexing needs a node that serves historical
> blocks and `eth_getLogs` (e.g. a free Alchemy/Infura key) — set `ETH_RPC_URL`.
> The bundled public endpoint follows the tip but rejects archive/log queries,
> so the monitor will index near-tip blocks and then log-and-retry. It degrades
> gracefully rather than crashing.

### Margin engine

`margin` is a simplified DeFi prime-broker risk layer. Given an account, it:

- **Reads on-chain positions** — ERC-20 `balanceOf` via `eth_call` (ABI-bound).
- **Values them** — each holding is marked to USD through a `PriceOracle`
  (Chainlink `latestRoundData` adapter; a static oracle backs tests).
- **Applies collateral factors** — per-asset haircuts give the weighted
  collateral (borrowing power).
- **Computes a health factor** — `weighted collateral / debt`, and a status:
  `healthy` → `margin_call` → `liquidatable`.

```
GET /api/v1/margin/{address}?debt_usd=1500
{ "gross_collateral_usd": "2000.00", "weighted_collateral_usd": "1600.00",
  "debt_usd": "1500.00", "health_factor": "1.0667", "status": "margin_call", ... }
```

The valuation and health-factor math is exact (`big.Rat`) and unit-tested at the
threshold boundaries (HF = 1.15 and 1.00), where a risk engine's correctness
actually matters. On-chain reads sit behind `BalanceReader` / `PriceOracle`
interfaces, so the risk logic tests with no node. Configure the collateral
registry (token, decimals, Chainlink feed, haircut) via `ASSETS_JSON`.

Producers publish domain events and don't know who consumes them; adding a
consumer is a deployment, not a change to producers. The `events.Bus`,
`user.Store`, and keystore boundaries make NATS→Kafka, in-memory→Postgres, and
keystore→KMS swaps implementation changes rather than redesigns.

## Run

```bash
docker compose up --build      # NATS + 4 services; gateway on :8080
make smoke                     # token → user → wallet → RBAC check
make logs                      # watch the notification service react to events
```

Manual flow:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"client_id":"admin-client","client_secret":"admin-secret"}' \
  | grep -o '"access_token":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"alice@example.com"}'

curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/wallets -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/wallets -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"   # admin-only
```

Without Docker: `make build && make test && make vet`.

## Security

- HS256 JWTs; the verifier pins the algorithm and rejects `alg=none` (tested).
- Gateway refuses to start in `ENV=production` with the default JWT secret.
- Wallet keys stored via go-ethereum's keystore (scrypt + AES-128-CTR + Keccak
  MAC); keys never leave the service.
- Services ship as static binaries on a distroless non-root base.
- Per-IP rate limiting, request-ID propagation, panic recovery, slowloris
  `ReadHeaderTimeout`.

## Layout

```
cmd/        service entrypoints (gateway, user, wallet, notification, chainmonitor, margin)
internal/   service-private logic (chainmonitor: indexer/reorg/decode; margin: valuation/risk)
pkg/        shared: auth, events (NATS bus), httpx, logging, server
migrations/ Postgres schema for the chain indexer
scripts/    smoke.sh
.github/    CI: fmt, vet, race tests, build, image build
```

## Roadmap

1. Kubernetes manifests behind an ingress controller.
2. Prometheus metrics + OpenTelemetry tracing across services.
3. Raft leader election so a single Chain Monitor instance ingests at a time.
